	# description
	"A sample progressive implementation of Latin rhotacism.<br/>NOTE: If the encoding is garbled, make sure both your operating system and RStudio (or whichever program is used for R) are set to UTF-8.  If this doesnâ€™t help, please only use ASCII in your project.  Support for Unicode under Windows is highly problematic for R, and indeed many other platforms. Future versions of R, or of soundcorrs, might be able to solve the problem, but for now the only solutions are either a switch to Linux or Mac, or sticking to pure ASCII."
