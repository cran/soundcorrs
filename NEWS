=============================

Fixes
* findPairs() with exact=F could not find matching segments if one of them
	was preceded by more than two linguistic zeros (e.g. "-|-|b" : "a|a|b"
	would fail for c("b","b")).
* Minor corrections to the vignette.

Additions
* A check that linguistic zeros are defined in the transcription.
* A check that linguistic zeros are separate segments.
* Linguistic zero to the trans-ipa.tsv sample transcription.
