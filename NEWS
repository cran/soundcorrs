=============================

Additions
* GUI now available via soundcorrsGUI (requires "shiny" and "shinyjqui").
* applyChanges() now has the "highlight" argument.
* findExamples() and soundchange() now have the "perl" argument.

Changes

soundcorrs 0.3.0 (2020-09-16)
=============================

Additions
* soundchange class to hold sound changes.
* applyChanges() function to apply a series of sound changes to a series of words.
* expandMeta() now supports binary notation.
* transcription objects now have two more fields: $meta and $values.
* Expanded documentation.

Changes
* Sample datasets are no longer available in the precompiled form because CRAN
	will not tolerate non-ASCII characters. They remain available through
	system.file ("extdata", "trans-common.tsv", package="soundcorrs"),
	as well as through loadSampleDataset().

Removals
* Sample transcription trans-common.tsv no longer contains metacharactes "x", "ɜ", and "ʌ".



soundcorrs 0.2.0 (2020-09-01)
=============================

Additions
* findExamples(), a replacement for findPairs() that is not limited
	to two languages, and can deal with missing values (NA).
* merge() to combine multiple soundcorrs objects.

Changes
* scOne is now obsolete.
	Reading is done with read.soundcorrs() or soundcorrs(), and the results
	are merged using merge().
* findPairs() is now just a wrapper around findExamples().
* ngrams() now has a different set of arguments.
* summary() now accepts more than two languages and doesn’t have the direction
	argument.
* table() is now called coocc().
	It accepts more than two languages and doesn’t have the direction argument.
* allTables() is now called allCooccs().
	It doesn’t have the direction argument anymore.
* Minor correcitions to various functions.

Removals
* findSegments() is no longer available.
	If you need its functionality, please contact kamil.stachowski@gmail.com.



soundcorrs 0.1.1 (2020-04-24)
=============================

Fixes
* findPairs() with exact=F could not find matching segments if one of them
	was preceded by more than two linguistic zeros (e.g. "-|-|b" : "a|a|b"
	would fail for c("b","b")).
* Minor corrections to the vignette.

Additions
* A check that linguistic zeros are defined in the transcription.
* A check that linguistic zeros are separate segments.
* Linguistic zero to the trans-ipa.tsv sample transcription.
